🌍 COVID Data Analysis & Dashboard Project

This project explores how COVID-19 spread across the world using real data on cases, deaths and vaccinations.
I cleaned the datasets using SQL, joined the deaths and vaccination tables, and built a complete interactive dashboard in Tableau.
The project shows end-to-end data skills from cleaning to visualization to deployment.
